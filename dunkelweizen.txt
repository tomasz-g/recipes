Ingredients:
5 lbs wheat malt
3 lbs light munich
1.25 lbs Briess 2-row
8 oz light crystal (20L)

wheat yeast (Wyeast Bavarian wheat or Yeast Labs W51)

Procedure:
This, along with a 90-minute boil, gave me the medium-amber color I was looking for. Time will tell if the crystal and chocolate will give the beer an undesirable harshness. I think you'd want a fairly soft finish in any weizen. I've tried this year's SA Summer Wheat (Dunkelweizen) and I think it's too harsh, as well as under-carbonated. The color's right, though.
